# scRNAseq to CollaboratorDB

This repository contains a little script to stage and upload all datasets in the **scRNAseq** package to the **CollaboratorDB** instance.
For simplicity, we'll just consider the default state of each dataset, without the extra stuff like Ensembl and multi-part components.
